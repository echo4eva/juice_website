                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                i love to play <span className="text-blue-300"><b>league of legends</b></span> so much! and ermahgerd lux is so fun. 
                her ult is literally like that “IMA FIRIN MAH LAZOR” guy from youtube ROFL XD.
                plus she is so pretty im literally her :3
                teemo is the cutest though! i love to play him botlane support! my adc might get mad
                but they're gay so whatevs XDDDD
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span className="text-blue-300"><b>valorant</b></span> is cool too! my first online fps game ive ever played!
                its cooler than  cs source and grandpa quake LOL.
                like why use nades when you have superpowers like jett (my gf)?
                peeps on the forums say valorants for noobs but idc, it’s fun4me.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span className="text-blue-300"><b>minecraft</b></span> and the <span className="text-blue-300"><b>sims</b></span> are my favorite comfort games!
                whenever my team is full of noobs and QQers on valorant or league and get pwned because i cant carry my heavy team alone,
                i take a break and relax mining on minecraft and making my teamspeak bffs on the sims!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span className="text-blue-300"><b>star wars battlefront</b></span> is one of the first games ive ever played that holds a special part in my heart &lt;333.
                im a huge starwars fan, so fun just pwning storm troopers as a jedi. its just like the movies, they cant aim XDDD
