                dont tell anyone, but yes i like kpop :3.
                ik it might seem weird but if you just listen and have an open mind about it, it&apos;s so good!
                the music is good and the girls are so pretty! i found this group named <span className="text-blue-300"><b>G-IDLE</b></span> on youtube,
                i can&apos;t really tell who&apos;s who on video because of the poor quality but they&apos;re so great at dancing too!
                my fav is miyeon, she&apos;s so f-ing pretty and has a marvelous voice! my favorite song by them is hwaa.
