                dont tell anyone, but yes i like kpop :3.
                ik it might seem weird but if you just listen and have an open mind about it, it’s so good!
                the music is good and the girls are so pretty! i found this group named <span className="text-blue-300"><b>G-IDLE</b></span> on youtube,
                i can’t really tell who’s who on video because of the poor quality but they’re so great at dancing too!
